# IsaacTown-Discord-Theme
A custom version of Comfy that MXRS IsaacTown uses
remember that this only works with the discord app and it won't work unless you have Better Discord download it here: http://betterdiscord.net/
how do you get the theme?
it's simple just hit the download code button. open discord (with better discord installed) go to settings and click on the themes tab. press open themes folder and drag the 2 or 3 files of code into the folder.
